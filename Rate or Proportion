# How to calculate the standard error (SE) of rate or proportion?

The SE of a rate or proportion is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in the estimate of that rate or proportion. The formulas for calculating it depend on the type of data and sample size.
1. Standard Error of a Proportion (single sample)
If you have a proportion p (e.g., proportion of successes in a sample) and a sample size n, the SE is calculated as: SE = sqrt(p(1-p)/n), where p is the sample proportion (the number of successes out of n samples).

2. Standard Error of a Rate 
For rates, which often measure events per unit of time or population, the standard error depends on whether the data follow a binomial or Poisson distribution:
a) Rate with Binomial Assumption
If the rate is calculated as a proportion (p) of successes out of n trials (similar to proportion): the formula for SE calculation is the same as above.
b) Rate with Poisson Assumption
If the rate is based on counts of events (x) over a population or time interval (N), and the events follow a Poisson distribution: SE = sqrt(x)/N, x is the number of events, N is the population size or total time observed.

Key Assumptions:
Proportions: Assumes the data follow a binomial distribution
Rates: Assumes counts follow either a binomial or Poisson distribution

If the sample size is small or the proportion is near 0 or 1, more advanced techniques may be needed (e.g., exact methods or confidence intervals)

Use SE for proportions when you are analyzing categorical data and calculating the fraction (or percentage) of observations in one category out of the total sample size.
Use SE for rates when you are analyzing counts of events over a specific population size or time frame. Rates often represent the frequency of an event per unit of population, time, or space.
- How to tell if a Number is a Rate or proportion?
A proportion is always between 0 and 1, it represents the fraction of a whole that belongs to a specific category.
A rate is often expressed as a number per unit population, time or space. It represents the frequency of events in a defined context. The numerator represents the number of events, and the denominator represents the total exposure, 
which could be time, population, or space. Rates are not necessarily between 0 and 1. 
- When proportions and rates overlap 
Sometimes a proportion can also be expressed as a rate, for example, if 60 out of 200 people get sick, the proportion is p = 0.3, and the rate is 30 cases per 100 people. In these cases, use proportion formulas for categorical data analysis (e.g., surveys)
Use rate formulas for event-frequency analysis (e.g., infection or accident rates).
